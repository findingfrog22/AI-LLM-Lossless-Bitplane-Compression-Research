Early-Alpha A0.3:
- Added file autodetect with selection menu
- Added basic auto-parsers that convert file data into tensors
- Added an embedding data autodetector

Mid-Alpha A0.4:
- Autodetect of quantization type, scalar type, input tensor type
- Tested support for .npy and .parquet files
- Symmetric Scalar Quantization with customizable precision (Custom Quantized Precision, autodetected scalar precision)(row-wise and column-wise)
- Dequantization (autodetect)
- Mean Square Error Quantization Analysis (multiple metrics, element-wise, vector-wise, dimension-wise, etc)
- Histogram .png generation for Quantized Values (files, not printed in terminal)

A0.5 late alpha - Binary Bit plane conversion: [porting features from previous simulation code]
- Binary string conversion
- Multiple Bitplane Disaggregation techniques (vertical, horizontal)
- Set Scalars to FP32 manually

Early Beta B0.7 - Compression Analysis: (porting features from previous simulation code)
- Quantized Compression Analysis (Horizontal, Vertical) [RLE, LZ4, ZSTD - Global, Temporal, Spatial]
- Shannon Entropy Analysis
- Controllable block size (parameters)
- Direct File Compression analysis (for comparison)
- Comparison of Quantized compression analysis to Non-quantized compression analysis
- more averaged results for more direct comparisons

Late Beta B0.9 - Finishing Touches: 
- File Randomization settings, 
- Row Selection Settings, 
- Better print formatting and explanations

Early Release V1.0 - Adding and testing for more filetypes:
- Added support for .csv
- Added support for .db
- added support for .jsonl

...and the future is TBD
