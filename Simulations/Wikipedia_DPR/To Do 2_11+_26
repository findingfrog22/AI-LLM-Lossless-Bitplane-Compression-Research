To Do 2/11+/26: (for A0.9.0)
- Implement 4kb LZ4 and ZSTD compression per bit plane
- add print titles above each LZ4 and ZSTD result table to explain what it is the result of (vertical, horizontal, quant, scale, single, multi, etc)
- add average analytics to the LZ4 and ZSTD Compression
- add explanations under each result to explain how to interpret results
- clean up code
- remove debug print statements

Note: this may be on hiatus for a bit as I focus on my next task. I want to make some code that universally handles embedding files from different data types, then integrate it into this simulation

Nice to haves to implement during beta:
- randomization features
- file scanning + selection
- control over block sizes
- direct compression of blocks (LZ4, ZSTD)
