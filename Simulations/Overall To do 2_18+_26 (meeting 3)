Our next task is to work on the overall simulation, we need code that can handle vector embeddings and data from different file types, sources, and formats
to do 2/18+/26:
- Check the accuracy of this simulation vs previous simulation (and check if formatting and conversions and bitplane stuff is correct)
- Finish LZ4+ZSTD Global, Temporal, and Spatial Code (has some issues right now)
Some of the lower priority tasks:
- adding explantions
- custom block sizes for compression
- direct compression
- maybe clean up code and comments? (some prints should probably be commented out for now)

From meeting 3:
- 1. add direct compression of 4KB block size (and/or controllable block size)
- 2. perform symmetric scalar quantization (with controllable block size and precision)
- 3. try rearrangement techniques and bitplane compression stuff (vertical, horizontal, LZ4, ZSTD, RLE)
- 4. ?? bitstring --> lossless compression

General goals for this:
- Abstract your code away to handle controllable parameters like datatypes and precision, make it more "universal" and simpler.
- Maybe use different files and call to them
